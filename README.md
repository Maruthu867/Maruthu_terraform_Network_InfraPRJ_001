# Maruthu_terraform_Network_InfraPRJ_001
This Terraform code creates an AWS VPC with public and private subnets, route tables, an Internet Gateway, a NAT Gateway, and two EC2 instances. The public subnet has internet access, while the private subnet uses the NAT Gateway. Run terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply to deploy. Ideal for secure, scalable AWS setups. ðŸš€
